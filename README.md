I developed a dynamic portfolio website using FastAPI as the backend framework and HTML/CSS for the frontend. The website showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a software developer, providing an interactive and responsive interface for visitors to explore my work. The aim was to create a fast, scalable, and easy-to-maintain platform that effectively presents my professional profile.

### Key features

**FastAPI Backend:** The backend is powered by FastAPI, which handles routing and serves static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). It provides a lightweight and asynchronous architecture for quick response times.
**Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, using CSS media queries to ensure compatibility across various devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
**Project Showcase:** The portfolio includes individual pages for each project, dynamically rendered with details such as descriptions, technology stack, and images.
**Contact Form:** Implemented a contact form where users can submit inquiries, which are handled by FastAPI and sent via email or stored in a database.
**SEO Optimization:** Applied best practices in structuring HTML tags and metadata to improve search engine visibility.


### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Setup your HTML file in templates folder
   ```
   create an index.html file in the templates folder
   ```

3. Start the application in development mode:
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

4. Test the application by making requests to endpoints.


### Technologies Used:

**Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Jinja2 templates for dynamic HTML rendering.
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript for interactivity and styling.
**Deployment:** Deployed on akashi.7o7.cx for public access, with proper version control using Git.
